Title: Python Coding Style & Best Practices Rubric

GRADING SCALE:
- Exceeding Expectations: 20 points
- Meets Expectations: 15 points
- Below Expectations: 10 points
- Minimal Effort: 5 points
- Failed: 0 points

CRITERION 1: Code Organization & Structure (Max: 20 points)
- Exceeding Expectations (20): Code is modular, with logical separation of responsibilities (e.g., helper functions, clear class hierarchy). Proper use of __main__ guards, no redundant code, consistent indentation.
- Meets Expectations (15): Code is organized and readable. Minor structural inefficiencies or slight redundancy.
- Below Expectations (10): Code structure is mostly functional but somewhat cluttered or inconsistent. Some duplication or unclear flow.
- Minimal Effort (5): Single long file with weak separation of concerns. Poor indentation or inconsistent structure.
- Failed (0): Code is disorganized or fails due to structure (e.g., nested definitions, missing entry point).

CRITERION 2: Readability & Naming Conventions (Max: 20 points)
- Exceeding Expectations (20): Consistent PEP 8 adherence: clear variable names (snake_case), class names (PascalCase), constants in UPPER_CASE. No abbreviations or single-letter identifiers (except i, j in loops).
- Meets Expectations (15): Mostly consistent naming; minor deviations (e.g., one or two camelCase or unclear names).
- Below Expectations (10): Frequent naming inconsistencies but still interpretable.
- Minimal Effort (5): Names are short, unclear, or inconsistent throughout.
- Failed (0): Nonstandard naming conventions dominate; variables or functions are incomprehensible.

CRITERION 3: Documentation & Comments (Max: 20 points)
- Exceeding Expectations (20): Comprehensive docstrings for all classes and functions, following Google/Sphinx or PEP 257 style. 
- Meets Expectations (15): Docstrings for most public methods and classes; comments add value.
- Below Expectations (10): Partial documentation; inconsistent docstring format.
- Minimal Effort (5): Sparse or superficial comments (e.g., “# do stuff”).
- Failed (0): No documentation or misleading comments.



Add up the criterion sub scores and return a total score out of 60



OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENT GUIDE:
- Count the number of classes, functions, and docstrings
- Check naming conventions using regex for snake_case vs camelCase
- Verify presence of main guards and modular organization
- Detect docstring coverage, f-string usage, and Pythonic constructs (list comprehensions, context managers)
- Execute code and capture runtime behavior for robustness scoring
