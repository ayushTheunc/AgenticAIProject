================================================================================
1. WHAT IS THIS SYSTEM?
================================================================================

The AI Code Grading Agent is a LOCAL APPLICATION that runs on your computer.
It is NOT a cloud service, web hosting platform, or online tool that requires
external servers.

Technical Description:
- Type: Stand-alone desktop application with two components
- Backend: Python-based REST API using FastAPI framework
- Frontend: React web interface that runs in your browser
- AI Engine: Connects to UNC's Azure OpenAI service for analysis
- Architecture: Client-server model running entirely on localhost


Current Ownership:
- Code Repository: Currently owned by the development team on GitHub
- Location: https://github.com/ayushTheunc/AgenticAIProject
- Access: Public repository - anyone can view and download
- Licensing: No formal license currently applied

================================================================================
2. HOW TO OBTAIN AND SET UP THE SYSTEM
================================================================================

OVERVIEW: You will download the application files to your computer, install
some required programs, configure your Azure OpenAI connection, and then run
the application locally whenever you need to grade code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: Install Required Software (One-Time Setup)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need four programs installed on your computer:

A. Python 3.12
   Purpose: Runs the backend grading engine
   Why this specific version: Python 3.14+ has compatibility issues with the
   AI libraries we use
   
   Installation:
   - Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Download Python 3.12 installer
   - Run the installer
   - IMPORTANT: On Windows, check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
   
   Verify installation:
   - Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
   - Type: python3.12 --version
   - You should see: Python 3.12.x

B. Node.js and npm
   Purpose: Runs the web interface
   
   Installation:
   - Go to https://nodejs.org/
   - Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version
   - Run the installer
   
   Verify installation:
   - Open Terminal/Command Prompt
   - Type: node --version
   - Type: npm --version
   - Both should display version numbers

C. Git
   Purpose: Downloads code from GitHub and clones student repositories
   
   Installation:
   - Go to https://git-scm.com/
   - Download installer for your operating system
   - Run the installer (default settings are fine)
   
   Verify installation:
   - Open Terminal/Command Prompt
   - Type: git --version
   - You should see git version information

D. Visual Studio Code (Recommended but optional)
   Purpose: Makes it easier to edit configuration files
   
   Installation:
   - Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Download installer
   - Run the installer
   
   Alternative: You can use any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.)

IMPORTANT: After installing all software, RESTART YOUR COMPUTER to ensure
everything is properly loaded.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: Download the Application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Option A - Using Git (Recommended):
1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
2. Navigate to where you want the application:
   cd Desktop
3. Download the code:
   git clone https://github.com/ayushTheunc/AgenticAIProject.git
4. Enter the project folder:
   cd AgenticAIProject

Option B - Direct Download:
1. Go to https://github.com/ayushTheunc/AgenticAIProject
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Click "Download ZIP"
4. Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop or Documents folder
5. Open Terminal/Command Prompt and navigate to that folder:
   cd Desktop/AgenticAIProject

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: Set Up the Backend (Server Component)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Create Python Virtual Environment
   This creates an isolated space for the application's Python packages.
   
   In Terminal/Command Prompt, inside the AgenticAIProject folder:
   
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   
   Then activate it:
   - Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
   - Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   You'll know it worked when you see (venv) at the start of your command line.

B. Install Python Dependencies
   This downloads all the AI and web server libraries needed.
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   This will take 2-5 minutes. You'll see lots of packages being downloaded.

C. Configure Azure OpenAI Connection
   This is CRITICAL - the application needs these credentials to work.
   
   1. Create a new file named ".env" in the AgenticAIProject folder
      - On Mac/Linux: touch .env
      - On Windows: type nul > .env
      - Or use Visual Studio Code: File > New File, save as ".env"
   
   2. Open .env in a text editor and add these lines:
   
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://azureaiapi.cloud.unc.edu
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-10-21
   
   3. Replace "your-api-key-here" with your actual Azure API key
      - You get this from UNC's Azure portal or your department IT contact
      - It looks like: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6 (THIS ISNT A VALID KEY)
   
   4. SAVE the file

D. Test the Backend
   Start the server:
   
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   
   You should see:
   "Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000"
   
   Open a web browser and go to: http://localhost:8000
   You should see a message like: {"message": "AI Code Grading Agent"}
   
   Leave this Terminal window OPEN and RUNNING.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4: Set Up the Frontend (Web Interface)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Open a NEW Terminal/Command Prompt window (keep the backend running)

A. Navigate to Frontend Folder
   
   cd frontend/agent

B. Install Frontend Dependencies
   
   npm install
   
   This will take 2-5 minutes and download the web interface components.

C. Start the Frontend
   
   npm start
   
   After a few seconds, your web browser should automatically open to:
   http://localhost:3000
   
   You'll see the AI Code Grading Agent interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 5: Test the System
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you have both components running:
- Backend server at http://localhost:8000 (Terminal window 1)
- Frontend interface at http://localhost:3000 (Terminal window 2)

Test with sample data:
1. In the web interface, paste this GitHub link:
   https://github.com/ayushTheunc/comp523testrepo

2. For the rubric, open the file "sampleRubric.json" in the AgenticAIProject
   folder and copy its entire contents into the rubric field.

3. Click "Grade Submission"

4. Wait 30-60 seconds. You should see grading results appear with scores and
   detailed feedback for each file.

If this works, the system is ready to use!

================================================================================
3. DAILY USAGE - HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION
================================================================================

Every time you want to use the grading system:

1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
2. Navigate to project: cd Desktop/AgenticAIProject (or wherever you put it)
3. Activate Python environment:
   - Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
   - Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
4. Start backend: uvicorn main:app --reload
5. Open NEW Terminal window
6. Navigate to frontend: cd Desktop/AgenticAIProject/frontend/agent
7. Start frontend: npm start
8. Browser opens to http://localhost:3000 - start grading!

When finished:
- Press Ctrl+C in both Terminal windows to stop the servers
- Close Terminal windows

================================================================================
4. OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER
================================================================================

Current State:
- The code is on GitHub under the student development team's account
- You do NOT own the repository yet

To Take Ownership:

Option A - Fork the Repository (Recommended):
1. Create a GitHub account (free) if you don't have one
2. Go to https://github.com/ayushTheunc/AgenticAIProject
3. Click "Fork" button (top right)
4. This creates YOUR copy of the code under your account
5. You now own and control this copy
6. Use your forked repository URL in Step 2 of setup

Option B - Download and Store Locally:
1. Follow the "Direct Download" method in Step 2
2. Store the ZIP file somewhere safe as a backup
3. You own the downloaded code, but won't get updates

Option C - Transfer Repository (Requires Student Team):
1. Create a GitHub account
2. Ask the student team to transfer repository ownership to your account
3. This gives you the original repository with all history

Recommended: Option A (Fork) is simplest and gives you full control.

================================================================================
5. ONGOING COSTS
================================================================================

Azure OpenAI API Usage:
- PRIMARY COST: Charged per AI request
- Cost Structure: Pay-per-token (approximately $0.03-0.06 per 1000 tokens)
- Typical Grading: ~2000-5000 tokens = $0.06-0.30 per submission
- Example: Grading 100 submissions = $6-$30
- Volume discounts may be available through UNC's Azure agreement

Current Semester Setup:
- You're using UNC's Azure OpenAI service
- Costs likely covered by department/university allocation
- Check with your IT department about:
  * Current spending limits
  * Who pays the Azure bills
  * How to monitor usage
  * Budget planning for future semesters



Cost Reduction Strategies:
1. Use grading agent for style/documentation only (let autograders check correctness)
2. Grade selectively (not every submission)
3. Batch multiple files together (already implemented)
4. Use for upper-level courses where style matters most

No Other Costs:
- No hosting fees (runs locally)
- No subscription fees
- No licensing fees
- No database costs
- No domain/server costs

IMPORTANT: Get confirmation from your IT department about:
- Who currently pays for Azure OpenAI access
- How to monitor spending
- Budget allocation for next semester
- Whether costs are centralized or per-department

================================================================================
6. TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE
================================================================================

Common Issues and Solutions:

Issue: "Python command not found"
Solution: Install Python 3.12, restart computer, ensure PATH is set

Issue: "Module not found" errors
Solution: Activate virtual environment (venv), run pip install -r requirements.txt

Issue: "Azure OpenAI error" or "Service Unavailable"
Solution: Check .env file has correct API key and endpoint

Issue: Frontend won't start
Solution: Make sure you're in frontend/agent folder, run npm install

Issue: "Connection refused" when grading
Solution: Ensure backend is running in separate Terminal window

Issue: "Repository not found" error
Solution: Student repository must be PUBLIC on GitHub

Getting Help:
1. Check README.md file for detailed technical documentation
2. Check existing GitHub Issues on the repository
3. Contact UNC Computer Science IT support
4. Post issue on GitHub repository (if you have questions)

Regular Maintenance Needed:

================================================================================
8. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
================================================================================

Current Limitations:
- Only works with PUBLIC GitHub repositories
- Processes submissions sequentially (not parallel)
- Runs on individual machines (not centralized)
- Requires technical setup knowledge
- No user authentication or access control
- No grading history or database storage

Potential Future Enhancements:
- Support for private repositories (requires GitHub token)
- Web-based deployment for easier access
- Database to track grading history
- Batch processing multiple students simultaneously
- Integration with Canvas/Gradescope

These enhancements would require additional development work.
